<h1>Week Two Challenge - Magic 8-Ball</h1>

Create a program that mimics the Magic 8 Ball. If you don't know what a Magic 8 Ball is ... it's a toy ball containing a clear 'window'. You shake the ball and ask it a question. A random response rises to the window. You can read about the Magic 8 Ball on Wikipedia (Links to an external site).Links to an external site.

Your program will prompt the user for a question and select a random answer from the list below. See the required output below the responses.

<p>● It is decidedly so</p>
<p>● Without a doubt</p>
<p>● Yes definitely</p>
<p>● You may rely on it</p>
<p>● As I see it, yes</p>
<p>● Most likely</p>
<p>● Outlook good</p>
<p>● Yes</p>
<p>● Signs point to yes</p>
<p>● Reply hazy try again</p>
<p>● Ask again later</p>
<p>● Better not tell you now</p>
<p>● Cannot predict now</p>
<p>● Concentrate and ask again</p>
<p>● Don't count on it</p>
<p>● My reply is no</p>
<p>● My sources say no</p>
<p>● Outlook not so good</p>
